# Jacks-Projects
This page was made to store and share my Java-based Music Transposition Project, which can be found in the Music folder.
This project was made using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition, so downloading the project and using it with IntelliJ will likely yield best results.
The program is based on the GUIDO music notation (https://guidodoc.grame.fr/), a text-based language for representing sheet music. 
I used a recursive-descent parser to recognize notes within the GUIDO language and transpose each note by a given number of half steps up or down.

Click "Code" and then "Download Zip" to download the Music project.

src folder: stores all the relevant classes for transposing sheet music (mark as Sources Root)

test folder: contains classes for running tests of certain unique cases and full pieces of sheet music (mark directory as Test Sources Root)

resources folder: contains text files to use when running the tests (mark directory as Test Resources Root)

If using IntelliJ, be sure to add JUnit4 and JUnit5.4 to classpath

See the comments within each Class for more specific information. You can reach me at jackbwaite@gmail.com with questions.
